# Brief Introduction About Myself

My name is Zaineb Marzaq. Iâ€™m currently enrolled in the ALX pathway Program. I'm passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems, especially in healthcare. 

I enjoy learning Git, GitHub, and building real solutions with code. I believe version control is a critical skill in my developer journey.
